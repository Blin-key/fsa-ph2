    <h1>The Tale of Docker's 'Hello World' Not Saying "Hello".</h1>
    <p>Alex had just landed his first job as a sysadmin at a bustling tech startup. Eager to prove himself, he decided to start with something simple: running Docker's 'hello world' container. He had read about Docker's ease of use and was excited to see it in action.</p>
    <p>With a cup of coffee in hand, Alex sat down at his desk and typed the command:</p>
    <pre><code>docker run hello-world</code></pre>
    <p>He hit enter and waited, expecting to see the cheerful message that Docker was known for. Instead, he was greeted with an error:</p>
    <pre><code>Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
docker: Error response from daemon: Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers).
See 'docker run --help'.</code></pre>
    <p>Alex's heart sank. He had followed the instructions perfectly, but something had gone wrong. Determined to solve the problem, he started troubleshooting. He checked his internet connection, restarted Docker, and even tried running the command again, but the error persisted.</p>
    <p>Feeling a bit defeated, Alex decided to ask for help. He posted his issue on a tech forum, hoping someone would have a solution. Within minutes, a seasoned sysadmin responded:</p>
    <blockquote>"Hey Alex, it looks like your Docker daemon is having trouble connecting to the Docker Hub. Try running `docker login` to authenticate your Docker client. If that doesn't work, check your firewall settings or network configuration."</blockquote>
    <p>Alex followed the advice and ran `docker login`. After entering his credentials, he tried the command again:</p>
    <pre><code>docker run hello-world</code></pre>
    <p>This time, the familiar message appeared:</p>
    <pre><code>Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.</code></pre>
    <p>Alex let out a sigh of relief and smiled. He had learned an important lesson: even simple tasks can have unexpected challenges, but with persistence and a willingness to seek help, he could overcome them. Feeling more confident, he moved on to his next task, ready to tackle whatever came his way.</p>
